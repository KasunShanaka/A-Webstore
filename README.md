# Project Description

This is an Online shop that i am currently building for starting my own business.
This site is still under construction. Therefore the project is not fully completed at this point.

(Also I only made this project public because of interviews 	:sweat_smile:)

I am using fucitional components here and I havent used Redux to manage states yet, but I will use it for this project.

### Why I choosed the technologies/tools I used,
    React js - large community base and Its a library that I'm already familiar. 
    Material UI - plenty of components and easier to customize each one.
    SCSS - Allows nesting and much easier to maintain.
    
### technologies/tools that I will use in this project,
    * Firebase
    * Nodejs
    * Express js
    * Stripe js
